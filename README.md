# Agent-Based Model to investigate the effects of cooperation and different characteristics of Marine Protected Areas on a simulated artisanal fishery

> ## NOTE 
The model is coded in python. It generates an output folder named **simulation_output** in your working directory, which contains a video of the simulation (**simulation_video.mp4**), data of the catch, and biomass dynamics of the fishermen (**simulation_data.csv**), and snapshots of each time step of the simulation. 

> ## WHAT IS IT ?
An Agent-Based Model (ABM) that captures the main characteristics of a small-scale, artisanal fishery. The model is used to disentangle the combined effects of fishing behaviour (expressed by a cooperative trait associated to fishing effort) and different designs of no-take fishery areas (presence or absence, size, distance between two areas, and age) on fish abundances and catches.

There are two types of agents,  fishermen (i.e. pirogues with fishing crews, marked with circles) and fish (marked with triangles). Agents are initially randomly distributed on a finite 2-D space. The different colors of the fishing units reflect the associated cooperative trait level, ranging from fully cooperative (black) to fully non-cooperative (lightest gray). 

The reproduction of fish agents is simulated as a stochastic process depending on a reproduction probability and on a logistic-type growth restriction. The fish agent movement is simulated using three sensory zones around the fish, namely, repulsion zone, parallel-orientation zone, and attraction zone. The harvest rate of a fishing agent is described according to Schaeferâ€™s model. The fishing agent moving towards the direction of a neighbouring agent exhibiting a greatest catch.

> ##  HOW TO USE IT

* The flag **MPA** determines whether the simulation includes an MPA or not for the whole duration of the run.
* The flag **Both** determines whether the simulation includes an MPA only for a period of the run.
* The  **Time_MPA** determines which time to terminate MPA, if **Both** is set to "yes".
* The **Type_MPA** determines the spatial configuration required (i.e. "spaced" or "single"), If **MPA**  = 'yes' or **Both** = 'yes'.
* The **Dist_MPA** sets the distance between the two MPAs, if **Type_MPA** = "spaced".
* The **Frac_MPA** sets the fraction of the fishing ground to be set as MPA, IF **MPA** = "yes" or **Both** = "yes"

# Design of the MPA simulation (size, distance of between network of areas and age MPA) #
MPA = 'yes'  # run with-only-MPA simulation? (A 'yes' implies only-with-MPA and 'no' implies only-without-MPA)
Both = 'no'  # run partly without-MPA and with-MPA? (A 'yes' implies partly (with-MPA and  with-MPA))
Time_MPA = 50 # If Both = 'yes', which time do you want to terminate the MPA? 
Type_MPA = 'single' # If MPA  = 'yes' or Both = 'yes', which spatial configuration do you want? (A 'spaced' implies two MPAs and 'single' implies only one MPA)
Dist_MPA = 0.2 # If Type_MPA = 'spaced', What should be the distance between the two MPAs ?
Frac_MPA = 0.25  # What fraction of the fishing environments should be set as MPA?
