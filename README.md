# Effects of cooperation and different characteristics of Marine Protected Areas on a simulated artisanal fishery

## Information
The model code is implemented in python. It generates an output folder named **simulation_output** in your working directory  which contains a video of the simulation (**simulation_video.mp4**), data of the catch and biomass dynamics of the fishermen (**simulation_data.csv**)  and snapshots of each time step of the simulation . 

## **Purpose**
We developed an agent-based model (ABM) inspired by the Senegalese Sardinella artisanal fishery to investigate the combine effects of fishermen that trades off cooperation and fishing effort, together with the effect of establishing a marine protective area (MPA). The cooperation vs. effort trade-off looks into the well-known issue of discounting the future. This trade-off is considered as a measure of the fraction of possible harvest a fisherman is willing to forego, in order to enjoy higher future harvest.

We also examined in tandem with the trade-off the effects of establishing an MPA in the region. In particular, we investigate how the size, age, and distance of a potential MPA impacts the fish biomass and total catch obtained by an artisanal  Sardinella fishery. We defined the size of the MPA as the proportion of no-take area from the total fishing ground, in percentage of total area. The age is defined as the time elapsed since the establishment of the MPA. Last, by distance we consider the spatial configuration of single MPA against two closely or distantly spaced MPAs.

With our ABM model we try to provide insights into the questions of: (1) Whether an MPA can serve as a possible insurance policy to sustain marine ecosystems when fishermen trade-off between cooperation and fishing effort? and (2) What is the impact the size, the age, and distance of MPA have on its conservation goals when fishermen show different levels of cooperation?
