# Effects of cooperation and different characteristics of Marine Protected Areas on a simulated artisanal fishery

## Information
The model code is implemented in python. It generates an output folder named **simulation_output** in your working directory  which contains a video of the simulation (**simulation_video.mp4**), data of the catch and biomass dynamics of the fishermen (**simulation_data.csv**)  and snapshots of each time step of the simulation .
