# Agent-based mode for marine protected areas

## Usage
The model code is implemented in python. To run the model, you need to download and run it (works on all version of python 1,2,3...). It generate a output folder in your working directory containing the snapshots of each time step of the simulation and a .csv file detailing resource, harvest dynamics. 

### **Purpose**
Our agent-based model (ABM) simulates the interaction between two agents namely, fisherman and the fish which are initially distributed randomly on a finite two-dimensional world. We seek to investigate how different marine protected areas (MPAs) spatial designs, otherwise known as no-take zones or marine reserves affects the harvesting behaviour of artisanal fishermen under different levels of cooperation. We considered four marine protected area spatial design namely, (1) no (2) single large (3) closely spaced and (4) distantly spaced MPA. The total surface area covered by the different MPA spatial design are equal. We also considered three levels of cooperation namely, (1) low  (2) intermediate  and (3) high. The specific questions our model addresses are: (1) Which  MPA spatial design provides greatest protection to fish biomass and highest fish catch to fishermen. (2) What is the impact of different levels of cooperation on the conservation effects of the different MPA spatial design?
